						<h2>I'm Dr. Kent Fellows, and this is my Website</h2>
					</header>
				
					<content>
					  <p>Welcome to my website, written in HTML and CSS by me (with significant help from online templates and tutorials) as evidence that I know just enough html coding to be dangerous.</p>
					  <p>It seems unlikely that you have arrived here without a specific purpose in mind, so I hope that you're able to find what you're looking for. And if not, may your browser find fair winds to carry you towards more fruitful pursuits.</p>

						<h2>A Bit About Me</h2>
					</header>
		
					<content>
					  <p>I'm an Assistant Professor in the Department of Economics at the University of Calgary, fully seconded to the School of Public Policy. I'm also the Associate Program Director of the Canadian Northern Corridor research program at The School of Public Policy and will shortly be taking on the role of  Director for the School's Master of Public Policy Program.</p>
					  <p> In addition to my roles at the University of Calgary I'm also a Fellow-in-Residence at the C.D. Howe Institute acting as an academic advisor and contributor to the Institute's Energy Policy program.<p>
					  <p> I specialize in multiple areas of Microeconomics including Competition Policy, Regulatory Economics, Energy Economics and Regional/Transportation Economics. Through my academic and policy publications I've been lucky to be able to provide advice on topics related to my areas of expertise to provincial, federal and international governments, including: The Government of Alberta, through the Energy Diversification Advisory Committee (2017) and the Economic Corridors Task Force (2021); The European Union as an expert panel member in their global infrastructure benchmarking assessment (2020-2021) and The Senate of Canada for their report on Economic Trade Corridors (2016).
					  <p>You can find links to (almost) all of my publications under the Academic Publications tab above.</p>

						<h2>The Background Picture</h2>
					</header>
		
					<content>
					  <p>This website is almost entirely devoted to my pursuits as an Academic and Consulting economist. The only indulgence is the background image behind/below the text here. It is a (particularly flattering) picture of my 1963 Lincoln Continental Convertible.</p>
					  <p>I'm currently in the lengthy process of restoring the car which was previously owned by my father. In fact, my grandfather purchased it used in Calgary in 1965 and it has been in the family ever since, so it's something of a family member at this point. </p>
